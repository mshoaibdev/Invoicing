              <p>

                expenses. Once a payment or deposit is made, it becomes
                nonrefundable. Clients, by submitting a deposit payment,

                expectation of their return.

              <h2 class="h3">Meta Mavericks Inc. Setup Fees</h2>
              <p>
                Setup fees are directly attributed to expenses incurred during the
                setup phase of SEO or Internet Marketing campaigns and are
                nonrefundable.
              </p>
  
              <h2 class="h3">Chargebacks</h2>
              <p>
                Clients are typically asked to provide credit card or payment
                information to facilitate the payment process for services. Any
                chargeback or payment dispute initiated by the client will result
                in the suspension of services, and, in some cases, the reversal of
                all work without notice. Clients will also be liable for the
                chargeback fee issued by the credit card company. Outstanding
                balances resulting from chargebacks must be settled in full before
                service restoration, file delivery, or project commencement.
              </p>
  
              <h2 class="h3">Website Hosting Services</h2>
              <p>
                All hosting payments, whether for the present or past months, are
                non-refundable. Web hosting accounts are set up from the order
                date and are allotted specific server resources based on the
                purchased plan. Upon installation of a client's hosting account,
                payment is considered due. If a client fails to utilize a hosting
                account set up by Meta Mavericks Inc., fees remain due and are
                non-refundable. Hosting billing cycles persist until a 30-day
                cancellation notice is received in writing from the client.
              </p>
  
              <h2 class="h3">Account Suspension</h2>
              <p>
                Hosting payments that are 15 days past due will trigger an account
                suspension. Hosting paid up to 12 months in advance, if canceled
                before the expiration date, will be refunded for the remaining
                months. Meta Mavericks Inc. reserves the right to disable or
                terminate a user's account, services, or contract in case of
                policy violations, and such termination will not be eligible for a
                refund. For a comprehensive understanding of our policies, please
